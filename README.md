# AI Orchestrator  
> **Multi-AI collaboration layer + long-term memory for large-scale coding**

---

## 🚀 TL;DR
- **AI Orchestrator (UAA)**: Enables GPT-5 / Claude / Gemini / Local LLM to collaborate and peer review, and directly operate the development environment.
- **JSON-RAG**: Provides long-term memory (JSON Source-of-Truth + Vector/FTS indexing), breaking through conversation length limitations.
- Combined → Enables AI to **continuously complete large-scale projects** (generate → review → correct → final delivery).

---

## ❓ Why
- Single models are limited by **context window**, large projects inevitably get interrupted.
- Lack of **cross-model peer review and task delegation**, quality is unstable.
- No **long-term retrievable project memory**, AI loses memory upon restart.

---

## 💡 What
**AI Orchestrator (UAA)**:
- Collaboration modes: sequential / parallel / iterative / review
- Intelligent routing: Automatically assigns tasks to the most suitable model
- Tool integration: Can read/write files, run tests, deploy (through MCP functionality)

**JSON-RAG**:
- JSON **Source of Truth** + Vector/FTS **Hybrid Search**
- Cross-conversation long-term memory, traceable, reduced token costs

## 🧪 Demo

### Multi-AI Code Collaboration (Fibonacci example)
Claude Sonnet generates → GPT-5 reviews → Sonnet corrects → Opus 4.1 final polish (production-grade code completed in 6.4 minutes)
